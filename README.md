Analysis Based on Findings
1. Introduction
The project aimed to predict electricity production using various time-series forecasting techniques. The dataset comprised temporal features like day and hour, along with weather-related variables. The data was preprocessed, normalized, and used to train several neural network models, including three Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and one Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The performance of these models was evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.

2. Data Quality Assessment
The initial data quality assessment revealed that the dataset was generally well-structured with no significant missing values. Visual inspections through plots indicated cyclical patterns in the electricity produption, aligning with daily and seasonal variations. The descriptive statistics helped in identifying the range and distribution of the features, ensuring that the data was suitable for model training.

3. Feature Engineering
To capture the temporal dynamics in the data, sine and cosine transformations were applied to the 'Day' and 'Hour' features. This approach effectively modeled the cyclical nature of time-series data. Additionally, the normalization of features and target variables ensured that the neural network models received inputs on a consistent scale, facilitating faster convergence and better performance.

4. Model Selection and Training
Four models were trained:

Three ANNs: Each with varying architectures to explore different depths and complexities.
One LSTM: Specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data.
The ANNs were chosen for their ability to model non-linear relationships, while the LSTM was selected for its strength in handling sequential data. The models were trained using the RMSprop optimizer, known for its efficiency in dealing with the non-stationarity of the data.

5. Model Performance Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

RMSE: This metric highlighted the average magnitude of errors, with a higher sensitivity to large deviations.
MAE: Provided a measure of the average absolute errors, less influenced by outliers compared to RMSE.
R²: Indicated the proportion of variance in electricity consumption explained by the models.

6. Key Findings
ANNs Performance: The ANNs demonstrated good predictive capabilities, with reasonably low RMSE and MAE values. The R² scores indicated that the models could explain a significant portion of the variance in the data.
LSTM Performance: The LSTM model showed superior performance in capturing the temporal dependencies, resulting in lower error metrics compared to the ANNs. This validated the choice of using LSTM for time-series forecasting.

7. Important Observations
Data Splitting: Splitting the data without shuffling preserved the temporal order, which is crucial for realistic time-series forecasting. This approach ensured that future data points were predicted based on past data, mimicking real-world scenarios.
Optimizer Choice: The use of the RMSprop optimizer facilitated efficient training of the neural networks, handling the non-stationarity and ensuring steady convergence.

8. Conclusion
The analysis confirmed that both ANNs and LSTM networks are effective in forecasting electricity consumption, with the LSTM model showing a slight edge due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies. The careful preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation steps contributed to the robustness and reliability of the predictions. Future work could explore incorporating additional external factors, such as economic indicators or energy prices, to further enhance the predictive accuracy.

9. Future Recommendations
Model Ensemble: Combining the predictions of multiple models (ensemble learning) could potentially improve forecasting accuracy.
Feature Expansion: Including more granular weather data or other external variables could provide additional insights.
Real-time Data Integration: Implementing real-time data feeds could allow for continuous model updating and more accurate short-term forecasts.
